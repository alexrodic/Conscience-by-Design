# ConscienceByDesign
A proof-of-concept implementation of the Conscience Layer — a new paradigm where AI systems self-evaluate their intentions, assess ethical resonance, justify their outputs, and remain accountable through cryptographically verifiable logs. Includes a minimal SRQ neural model with built-in explainability.
