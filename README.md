# Conscience Layer Prototype — 2025 Edition  
### Embedding Ethical Awareness into Artificial Intelligence

## 🧭 Overview  

The **Conscience Layer Prototype** is part of the *Conscience by Design Framework* —  
an open research project focused on **AI ethics**, **machine conscience**, and **value alignment**.  

It explores how **ethical awareness** can be **embedded directly into artificial intelligence systems**  
to ensure transparency, accountability, and human-centered alignment.  

While the framework defines the **philosophical and structural foundations** of ethically aligned AI,  
the prototype represents its **functional implementation**: a working model that transforms  
moral reasoning into a measurable and computational process.

## ⚙️ How It Works  

The prototype implements a modular **ethical layer for AI systems** that evaluates every decision through three measurable dimensions:

| Dimension | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Truth Integrity Score (TIS)** | Evaluates the integrity and bias of incoming data — ensuring AI truthfulness. |
| **Human Autonomy Index (HAI)** | Measures how well system goals respect human freedom, intent, and dignity. |
| **Societal Resonance Quotient (SRQ)** | Quantifies empathy, fairness, and social coherence in AI outputs. |

Each process follows three ethical reasoning stages:  

1. **Input Awareness (TIS):**  
   Verifies data sources, bias, and context integrity before the model acts.  
2. **Intent Mapping (HAI):**  
   Compares AI intent with human values and moral constraints to ensure alignment.  
3. **Ethical Feedback (SRQ):**  
   Evaluates emotional, social, and cultural resonance of the output.  

Every result is stored in a **cryptographically verifiable transparency log** —  
an *Ethical Proof of Work* that provides explainable accountability for AI decisions.

## 🧠 Core Components  

- **SRQModel (PyTorch MLP):**  
  Neural model predicting *Societal Resonance Quotient (SRQ)* from ethical input features.  

- **Explainability Layer:**  
  Implements *SHAP* (exact or permutation) and *LIME* (local regression)  
  for model interpretability and transparency audits.  

- **ConscienceLayer Class:**  
  The heart of the prototype — integrating TIS, HAI, SRQ metrics and maintaining  
  an immutable ethical audit trail.  

- **Simulation Environment:**  
  Generates synthetic ethical decision data to test AI conscience performance  
  across multiple iterations and seeds.

## 🧬 Philosophy  

The **Conscience by Design Framework** was created to align technological progress  
with ethical intelligence and human values.  

It argues that **responsible AI** cannot rely only on external regulation,  
but must include an **internal moral architecture** — a conscience.  

The **Conscience Layer Prototype** demonstrates this principle in practice,  
making ethical reflection a built-in process rather than a post-factum correction.
