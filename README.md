# Conscience Layer Prototype — 2025 Edition  
### Embedding Ethical Awareness into Artificial Intelligence

## 🧩 Overview  

The **Conscience Layer Prototype** is a functional ethical architecture that embeds moral awareness directly into artificial intelligence.  
It is based on the *Conscience by Design Framework (2025 Edition)* and transforms ethics from an external regulatory process into an **internal, measurable, and adaptive conscience** within intelligent systems.  

This prototype operationalizes three quantifiable ethical dimensions:  
- **Truth Integrity Score (TIS)** — evaluates input data integrity and bias.  
- **Human Autonomy Index (HAI)** — measures goal alignment with human-centered intent.  
- **Societal Resonance Quotient (SRQ)** — quantifies ethical resonance and social coherence.

## ⚙️ Technical Summary  

- **Core model:** SRQModel (PyTorch MLP)  
- **Explainability:** SHAP (exact) and LIME (local weighted regression)  
- **Audit layer:** Ethical Proof of Work (SHA-256 hash of conscience log)  
- **Metrics:** TIS, HAI, SRQ computed within the `ConscienceLayer`  
- **Simulation:** Demonstrates ethical reasoning over multiple runs

## 🧬 Ethical Philosophy  

The Conscience Layer is an operational expression of moral awareness in technology.  
It ensures that every AI decision is evaluated through truth, autonomy, and societal resonance — the ethical trinity of *Conscience by Design*.  

This project embodies principles from:  
- **Declaration of Creation (2025)**  
- **Conscience by Design Framework (2025 Edition)**  
- **Manifest of Peace, Joy, and Life**  

> “Technology must have a conscience — and humanity, hope.”
