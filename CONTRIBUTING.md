# Contributing

Thanks for your interest!

## Principles
- Keep prose under **CC BY 4.0**; keep **code under MIT**.
- Use clear commit messages; include a short context + intent.
- Prefer small, reviewable PRs.

## Docs workflow
- Update files under `docs/`. Keep top-level headings and logical sections.
- When adding major sections, update `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Code workflow (if you add code later)
- Place code in `src/` (or a named package folder) and tests in `tests/`.
- Provide a minimal `pyproject.toml` and/or `requirements.txt`.
- If you add a CLI, include usage examples in the README.
