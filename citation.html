    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      The Conscience Layer Prototype (2025) is an ethical AI architecture developed within
      the Conscience by Design Framework by Aleksandar Rodić. It operationalizes measurable
      moral reasoning inside artificial intelligence through three quantifiable dimensions:
      <strong>Truth Integrity Score (TIS)</strong>, <strong>Human Autonomy Index (HAI)</strong>,
      and <strong>Societal Resonance Quotient (SRQ)</strong>.
      The system integrates explainability methods (exact SHAP, closed-form LIME)
      and a cryptographically auditable transparency mechanism known as the
      <em>Ethical Proof-of-Work</em>. Authored and open-sourced by Aleksandar Rodić,
      it represents a foundational step toward human-aligned, transparent, and morally aware AI systems.
