# Security & Ethical Use Policy  
**Conscience Layer Prototype - Responsible AI & Data Integrity Framework**  

---

## Guiding Principle  

The Conscience Layer is designed as an ethical architecture - not merely as a technical component.  
Security in this context extends beyond data protection; it includes **moral integrity**, **human dignity**, and **societal safety**.  
All contributions and uses of this repository must uphold these values.  

> “Security without conscience is control; conscience without security is chaos.” - Aleksandar Rodić (2025)

## Responsible Disclosure  

If you discover a potential **vulnerability, ethical inconsistency, or misuse scenario**, please report it **privately**.  
We prioritize responsible disclosure and moral safety over publicity.  

### Contact for confidential reporting:
- [darko.knezevic@rodagrupa.rs](mailto:darko.knezevic@rodagrupa.rs)  
- [marko.nisic@influencers.rs](mailto:marko.nisic@influencers.rs)  

You will receive acknowledgment within 72 hours and a detailed response within 14 days.  
All disclosures are handled with confidentiality and mutual respect.

## Scope of Ethical Security  

This project treats **ethical vulnerabilities** with the same priority as technical ones.  
Please report issues related to:  
- Algorithmic bias or unintended manipulation.  
- Violation of Truth Integrity (TIS), Human Autonomy (HAI), or Societal Resonance (SRQ).  
- Risks of misuse for surveillance, discrimination, or disinformation.  
- Breaches of privacy, data provenance, or consent.  

All ethical reports are reviewed by a **dual team** - technical and moral oversight - ensuring balanced evaluation and remediation.

---

## Transparency & Audit  

- Each ethical incident or patch is logged in the **tamper-evident audit trail** of the Conscience Layer.  
- Every commit related to integrity or alignment includes a cryptographic signature (`sha256` checksum).  
- Contributors are encouraged to include an *Ethical Impact Summary* in pull requests that modify evaluation logic or thresholds.
