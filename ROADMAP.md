# Roadmap  
*Conscience Layer Prototype — Ethical AI Architecture (2025–2026)*  

This roadmap outlines the planned milestones for the continued development, validation, and dissemination of the **Conscience by Design Framework** and its functional implementation — the **Conscience Layer Prototype**.

---

## Q4 2025 — Public Release & Validation  

- ✅ Finalize and release the stable open-source edition of the Conscience Layer Prototype.  
- Conduct reproducibility testing and formal verification of TIS, HAI, and SRQ metrics.  
- Publish whitepaper and technical brief aligned with the EU AI Act and UNESCO ethical AI standards.  
- Begin community onboarding for open scientific collaboration and peer review.

---

## Q1 2026 — Expansion & Institutional Packaging  

- Integrate continuous integration (CI) pipelines for automated ethical validation and version control.  
- Release **UN-style PDF documentation** and policy-aligned metadata for global standard bodies (UNESCO, OECD, IEEE).  
- Package the prototype as a reproducible research module (`pip install conscience-layer`) with example notebooks and datasets.  
- Establish the *Conscience by Design Research Consortium* for multi-institutional testing.

---

## Q2 2026 — Evaluation & International Collaboration  

- Deploy pilot evaluations in cooperation with academic and civic technology labs.  
- Collect comparative datasets on ethical alignment, transparency, and human–AI trust metrics.  
- Prepare submissions to leading AI ethics conferences and journals (NeurIPS Ethics, AAAI FAccT, Nature Machine Intelligence).  

---

## Q3–Q4 2026 — Long-Term Impact Phase  

- Launch the **Conscience Layer v2.0** integrating multilingual moral context modeling and cross-domain ethical auditing.  
- Establish a digital ethics observatory for monitoring the societal resonance of AI systems in deployment.  
- Publish the *Declaration of Machine Conscience — 2026 Edition*, documenting global adoption and next research frontiers.
