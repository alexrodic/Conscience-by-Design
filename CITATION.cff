abstract: >
  The Conscience Layer Prototype (2025) is an ethical AI architecture developed within
  the Conscience by Design Framework by Aleksandar Rodić. It operationalizes measurable
  moral reasoning inside artificial intelligence through three quantifiable dimensions:
  Truth Integrity Score (TIS), Human Autonomy Index (HAI), and Societal Resonance Quotient (SRQ).
  The system integrates explainability methods (exact SHAP, closed-form LIME) and a cryptographically
  auditable transparency mechanism known as the Ethical Proof-of-Work. Authored and open-sourced by
  Aleksandar Rodić, it represents a foundational step toward human-aligned, transparent,
  and morally aware AI systems.
