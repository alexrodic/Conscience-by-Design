Conscience Layer — Ethical Awareness Core
Aleksandar Rodić (2025)

Original concept, architecture, and implementation authored by Aleksandar Rodić.
Developed as part of the “Conscience by Design Framework” (2025 Edition).

This work defines the first operational model of embedded ethical awareness within artificial intelligence systems, introducing measurable conscience metrics (Truth Integrity Score, Human Autonomy Index, and Societal Resonance Quotient) and functional mechanisms for auditability, transparency, and proportionality.
