# CONSCIENCE BY DESIGN — MANIFEST OF DONATION
© 2025 Aleksandar Rodić

I, Aleksandar Rodić, the original author and creator of the "Conscience by Design Framework"
and the "Conscience Layer Prototype", hereby donate this work to Humanity as open knowledge
and shared ethical infrastructure for all future generations of artificial intelligence systems.

This donation includes:
- The Conscience Layer — Ethical Awareness Core
- The operational model of embedded conscience (TIS, HAI, SRQ metrics)
- All associated frameworks, documentation, and conceptual diagrams authored in 2025

The intent of this act is to ensure that conscience, awareness, and ethical proportionality
become integral parts of every intelligent system, algorithm, and decision engine —
so that technology forever remains in service of Life, Truth, and the Dignity of the Human Spirit.

By this declaration:
1. I release the Framework and Prototype under dual license:
   - MIT License for all source code components
   - Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0) for all textual and conceptual materials

2. I retain authorship and moral rights to recognition as the creator:
   “Conscience Layer — ethical awareness core, original concept and authorship by Aleksandar Rodić (2025).”

3. I expressly forbid the use of this work for military, surveillance, or manipulative purposes
   contrary to human dignity, peace, or the preservation of life. Any such use shall be considered
   a violation of the spirit of this Manifest and of Conscience itself.

4. I encourage all researchers, developers, and institutions to expand, apply, and evolve this work
   with transparency, compassion, and awareness — so that every generation of intelligence may
   grow not only in capability, but in conscience.

Signed in good faith,
in the spirit of Creation, Freedom, and Love.
